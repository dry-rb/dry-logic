  - A new `uri?` predicate that you can use to verify `URI` strings, ie `uri?("https",
    "https://dry-rb.org")` (@nerburish)
  changed: &2
  - "`size?` argument is now called `num` which fixes a regression on dry-schema side
    (see #72 for more details) (@tadeusz-niemiec)"

  added: 
  changed: 
- version: 1.0.5
  date: '2019-11-07'
  fixed:
  - Make `format?` tolerant to `nil` values. It already worked like that before, but
    starting Ruby 2.7 it would produce warnings. Now it won't. Don't rely on this
    behavior, it's only added to make tests pass in dry-schema. Use explicit type
    checks instead (@flash-gordon)

  date: '2019-11-06'
  fixed:
  - Fix keyword warnings (@flash-gordon)

  date: '2019-06-04'
  added:
  - "`uuid_v4?` predicate (radar)"
  - "`respond_to?` predicate (waiting-for-dev)"
  summary: This release was removed from rubygems because it broke dry-schema.

  - Predicates simply reuse other predicate methods instead of referring to them via
    `#[]` (georgemillo)
  fixed:
  - Warnings on MRI 2.4.0 are gone (jtippett)
- version: 0.4.0
  date: '2016-09-21'
  summary: This is a partial rewrite focused on internal clean up and major performance
    improvements. This is also the beginning of the work to make this library first-class
    rather than "just" a rule backend for dry-validation and dry-types.

    object (solnic)"
  - "`Logic.Rule` builder function (solnic)"
